# 2.1.0-Beta (https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/releases/tag/v2.1.0-beta) (02/24/2020)

### Potentially Breaking Changes

- The new CFWheels internal GUI is more isolated and runs in it's own component: previously this was extending the developers main `Controller.cfc` which caused multiple issues. The migrator, test runner and routing GUIs have therefore all been re-written.
- The plugins system behaviour no longer chains multiple functions of the same name as this was a major performance hit. It's recommended that plugin authors check their plugins to run on 2.1
- HTTP Verb/Method switching is now no longer allowed via GET requests and must be performed via POST (i.e via `_method`)
