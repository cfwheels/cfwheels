# CFWheels Core
**Finally, a framework for the rest of us!**

CFWheels is an open source CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language) framework inspired by Ruby on Rails that provides fast application development, a great organization system for your code, and is just plain fun to use. One of our biggest goals is for you to be able to get up and running with CFWheels quickly. We want for you to be able to learn it as rapidly as it is to write applications with it.

## What's included in this package?
This package includes the core CFWheels directory and is used as a dependency by the core CFWheels templates. 

## To install
You probably will never need to install this directory by itself but just incase you do you can install it using:

`box install cfwheels-core`

Typically this package is installed automatically by one of the CFWheels templates like this:

`box install cfwheels-template-base`

This command installs the base template which includes all the directories your applicaiton will need and then install this package as a dependency.
