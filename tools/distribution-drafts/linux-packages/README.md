# Linux packages — `.deb` / `.rpm`

Two-phase plan. Phase 1 ships the packages as GitHub Release artifacts (users
`wget` + `apt install ./pkg.deb`). Phase 2 stands up a proper apt/yum repo
served from Cloudflare Pages so users get auto-update via `apt update`.

## Phase 1: GitHub Release artifacts (in scope for Tuesday GA)

Already drafted in this directory:

- `nfpm-wheels.yaml` — stable channel package config
- `nfpm-wheels-be.yaml` — bleeding-edge channel package config
- `build-linux-packages.sh` — wrapper that stages content + runs nfpm

The build is wired into release.yml and publish-snapshot.yml as a parallel
artifact stream alongside the existing zip/tar.gz. Users on Linux who want to
opt in pre-Phase-2 do:

```bash
# Stable
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/wheels-dev/wheels/releases/download/v4.0.0/wheels_4.0.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./wheels_4.0.0_amd64.deb

# Bleeding-edge — note the `.` (not `~`) in the URL; see "Tilde mangling" below
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/wheels-dev/wheels-snapshots/releases/download/v4.0.1-snapshot.1700/wheels-be_4.0.1.snapshot.1700_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./wheels-be_4.0.1.snapshot.1700_amd64.deb
```

Same for RPM via `dnf install`.

The `~snapshot` tilde is required: `.deb` and `.rpm` use `~` (not `-`) as the
pre-release separator. The build script translates `-snapshot.N` to
`~snapshot.N` automatically. Both result in the snapshot package sorting
*below* the next GA version per `dpkg --compare-versions` and `rpmvercmp`.

### Tilde mangling on GitHub Releases (sharp edge)

The on-disk filename produced by nfpm is `wheels_4.0.0~snapshot.1787_amd64.deb`
(correct SemVer pre-release form with `~`). However, **GitHub Releases silently
rewrites `~` to `.` in uploaded asset filenames**, so the downloadable URL is
`wheels_4.0.0.snapshot.1787_amd64.deb`.

This is a one-way mangling at upload time — the URL form is the only form
consumers can `curl`. The metadata *inside* the package still contains `~`
(verifiable via `dpkg-deb -I` or `rpm -qip`), so once installed, `apt`/`dpkg`
order the version correctly relative to GA releases. Only the delivery handle
changes.

Verify on any snapshot:
```bash
gh release view v4.0.0-snapshot.1787 --repo wheels-dev/wheels-snapshots \
  --json assets -q '.assets[].name' | grep -E '\.(deb|rpm)$'
# wheels-4.0.0.snapshot.1787.x86_64.rpm
# wheels_4.0.0.snapshot.1787_amd64.deb
```

Practical impact for this directory:
- `build-linux-packages.sh` writes the `~`-form to disk (correct for nfpm and
  on-server `dpkg`). Uploading the artifact is what produces the `.`-form URL.
- Anyone publishing a download URL (docs, install scripts, brew formulae,
  Phase 2 apt repo metadata) MUST use the `.`-form or hit 404.

## Phase 2: apt.wheels.dev / yum.wheels.dev (post-Tuesday)

Two-repo pattern (one bucket-control repo per package format):

- `wheels-dev/apt-wheels` — workflow + scripts + signing key + landing page;
  the apt metadata + `.deb` pool live in **Cloudflare R2 bucket `wheels-apt`**,
  served at `apt.wheels.dev` via R2's custom-domain feature.
- `wheels-dev/yum-wheels` — same pattern; R2 bucket `wheels-yum` serves
  `yum.wheels.dev`.

A CI workflow on each bucket repo listens for `repository_dispatch` from
the source repo's release workflows, fetches new artifacts, syncs the
existing pool from R2, regenerates metadata, signs with GPG, and uploads
the changes back to R2. R2's edge serves the new files within seconds.

> **Why R2 and not Pages:** Cloudflare Pages enforces a hard 25 MiB
> per-file limit. The Wheels `.deb` and `.rpm` are ~80 MB each. The
> original Phase 2 sketch used Pages; the architecture pivoted to R2
> during rollout. End-user URLs are unchanged — both `apt.wheels.dev`
> and `yum.wheels.dev` still serve at the same paths.

**Filename gotcha for the metadata generator**: when fetching snapshot
artifacts from the source repo's GitHub Release, the URL filenames have `.`
where the nfpm-produced names had `~` (see "Tilde mangling" above). The
metadata generator must compute the `.`-form filename to actually fetch the
file, then either:

1. Rename to the `~`-form in `pool/` so `Packages.gz` `Filename:` fields use
   the canonical SemVer pre-release name (preferred — matches what users see
   from `apt-cache show`), or
2. Keep the `.`-form on disk in `pool/` and emit `.`-form in `Packages.gz`
   (simpler — fewer renames in the pipeline).

Either way is correct on the `apt`/`dpkg` ordering side, since the version
field inside the `.deb`'s control metadata still has `~`. Pick one and stay
consistent; option 1 reads more naturally if a user pokes around at
`apt.wheels.dev/pool/` directly.

User setup post-Phase-2:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
curl -fsSL https://apt.wheels.dev/wheels.gpg \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/wheels.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/wheels.gpg] https://apt.wheels.dev stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wheels.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install wheels
# For BE: replace `stable` with `bleeding-edge` in the sources line.

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://yum.wheels.dev/wheels.repo
sudo dnf install wheels
```

### Phase 2 is live

`apt.wheels.dev` and `yum.wheels.dev` are live, served from Cloudflare R2. The
bucket repos — [`wheels-dev/apt-wheels`](https://github.com/wheels-dev/apt-wheels)
and [`wheels-dev/yum-wheels`](https://github.com/wheels-dev/yum-wheels) — are
the source of truth for the receiver workflow, regen/signing scripts, and
landing page. Edit them directly; this directory only holds the nfpm build
configs (`build-linux-packages.sh`) that produce the `.deb`/`.rpm` assets.

### Why split into two CF Pages sites instead of one

A single site at `packages.wheels.dev/apt/...` would work but produces uglier
sources.list lines (`deb https://packages.wheels.dev/apt stable main` vs the
cleaner `deb https://apt.wheels.dev stable main`). The two-subdomain layout
matches what most projects use (Docker, Caddy, Tailscale, etc.) so it's the
form Linux admins recognize.

## Universal install script (Phase 2 polish)

Once apt/yum are live, the universal `https://wheels.dev/install.sh` script
detects the OS and runs the right setup. Pseudo-code:

```bash
case "$(uname -s)" in
  Darwin) brew install wheels ;;
  Linux)
    if command -v apt-get >/dev/null; then
      # paste the apt setup snippet
    elif command -v dnf >/dev/null; then
      # paste the yum setup snippet
    else
      # fallback: download .deb/.rpm or .tar.gz from GitHub Release
    fi
    ;;
esac
```

Hosted from a Worker on the same wheels.dev CF zone — five-minute setup once
Phase 2 is in place.
