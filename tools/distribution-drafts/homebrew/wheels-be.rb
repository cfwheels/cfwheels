# Wheels Bleeding-Edge Channel — Homebrew Formula
#
# Companion to wheels.rb (stable). This formula tracks pre-release snapshots
# published from the develop branch on every merge.
#
# Conflicts with `wheels` (both ship `bin/wheels`); brew refuses to link both at
# once, so a user is on exactly one channel at a time. Switch with:
#
#   brew uninstall wheels && brew install wheels-be   # stable -> BE
#   brew uninstall wheels-be && brew install wheels   # BE -> stable
#
# Already-scaffolded apps are unaffected: vendor/wheels/ is committed at
# scaffold time, so switching channels only affects what NEXT `wheels new`
# produces.
#
# Auto-bump: a workflow in this tap (wheels-be-bump.yml) listens for
# `repository_dispatch` events of type `snapshot-published` from
# wheels-dev/wheels (the publish-snapshot.yml workflow fires them). On dispatch,
# it computes the new sha256s, opens a PR bumping the URL/version/sha256 fields
# in this file. Tap CI validates and a maintainer rubberstamps.
