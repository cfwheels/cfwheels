## Examples
	
		Valid syantax is:

		[operator] [version]

		The following operators are supported:

		=  Equals version
		!= Not equal to version
		>  Greater than version
		<  Less than version
		>= Greater than or equal to
		<= Less than or equal to
		~> Approximately greater than

		The first six operators are self explanitory. The Approximate operator `~>` can be thought
		of as a `between` operator. For example, if the developer wanted their plugin to support a
		wheels version that was between 1.1 and 1.2, they could do:

		<cffunction name="init">
			<cfset this.version = "~> 1.1">
			<cfreturn this>
		</cffunction>

		To use, you pass in the version and versioning strings:

		<cfset loc.passed = semanticVersioning(this.version, application.wheels.version)>
