# Rendering Content

*Showing content to the user.*

A big part of a controller's task is to respond to the user. In Wheels you can respond to the user in
three different ways:

  * Displaying content
  * Redirecting to another URL
  * Sending a file

You can only respond once per request. If you do not explicitly call any of the response functions
(`renderView()`, `sendFile()`, etc.), then Wheels will assume that you want to show the view for the
current controller and action and do it for you.

This chapter covers the first method listed above - displaying content. The chapters about
[Redirecting Users][1] and [Sending Files][2] cover the other two response methods.

## Rendering a Page

This is the most common way of responding to the user. It's done with the `renderView()` function, but
most often you probably won't call it yourself and instead let Wheels do it for you.

Sometimes you will want to call it though and specify to show a view page for a controller/action other
than the current one. One common technique for handling a form submission, for example, is to show the
view page for the controller/action that contains the form (as opposed to the one that just handles the
form submission and redirects the user afterwards). When doing this, it's very important to keep in mind
that `renderView()` will *not run the code* for the controller's action - all it does is process the
view page for it.

You can also call `renderView()` explicitly if you wish to cache the response or use a different layout
than the default one.

If the `controller` and `action` arguments do not give you enough flexibility, you can use the `template`
argument that is available for `renderView()`.

Please refer to the [Pages][3] chapter for more details about rendering content. More specifically, that
chapter describes where to place those files and what goes in them.

## Rendering a Partial

This is done with the `renderPartial()` function. It's most often used with AJAX requests that are meant
to update only parts of a page.

## Rendering Nothing

Sometimes you don't need to return anything at all to the browser. Perhaps you've made an AJAX request
that does not require a response or executed a scheduled task that no end user sees the results of. In
these cases you can use the `renderNothing()` function to tell Wheels to just render an empty page to
the browser.

## Rendering Text

This is done with the `renderText()` function. It just returns the text you specify. In reality it is
rarely used but could be useful as a response to AJAX requests sometimes.

## Rendering to a Variable

Normally when you call any of the rendering functions, the result is stored inside an internal Wheels
variable. This value is then output to the browser at the end of the request.

Sometimes you may want to do some additional processing on the rendering result before outputting it
though. This is where the `returnAs` argument comes in handy. It's available on both `renderView()` and
`renderPartial()`. Setting `returnAs` to `string` will return the result to you instead of placing it in
the internal Wheels variable.

## Caching the Response

Two of the functions listed above are capable of caching the content for you; `renderView()` and
`renderPartial()`. Just pass in `cache=true` (to use the default cache time set in `config/settings.cfm`)
or `cache=x` where `x` is the number of minutes you want to cache the content for. Keep in mind that
this caching respects the global setting set for it in your configuration files so normally no pages
will be cached when in Design or Development mode.

We cover caching in greater detail in the [Caching][4] chapter.

## Using a Layout

The `renderView()` function accepts an argument named `layout`. Using this you can wrap your content
with common header/footer style code. This is such an important concept though so we'll cover all the
details of it in the chapter called [Using Layouts][5].
