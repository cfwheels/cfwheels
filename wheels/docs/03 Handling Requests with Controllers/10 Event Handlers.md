# Event Handlers

*Use the standard CFML application events through the framework.*

Because the `Application.cfc` file in the root of your Wheels site just includes the 
`wheels/functions.cfm` file, which in turn includes a lot of framework specific code, you may wonder 
what the best way is to use CFML's `OnApplicationStart`, `OnRequestStart` and similar functions...

While it's perfectly possible to add your code directly to the `wheels/functions.cfm` file, we certainly 
don't recommend it. If you add code in there, you both increase the risk of accidentally modifying how 
the framework functions, and you also make it a lot harder to upgrade to future versions of Wheels.

## Use the `events` Folder for Standard CFML Events

The general recommendation is to never touch any files in the `wheels` folder. OK, with that little 
warning out of the way, how does one go about using the CFML events?

The answer is to use the `events` folder. There is a file in there for every single event that CFML 
triggers. So if you want some code executed on application start for example, just place your code in 
`onapplicationstart.cfm`, and Wheels will run it when your application starts.

## Wheels Includes Some Extra Bonus Events

If you look closely in the `events` folder, you will also notice that there are some custom files in 
there that do not match up with standard CFML events. The `onmaintenance.cfm` file is one example. Let's 
have a closer look at these.

### On Maintenance

The `onmaintenance.cfm` file is included when Wheels is set to `maintenance` mode. After the file is 
included, `cfabort` is called by Wheels so no other code runs in this mode.

### On Error

You can place a generic error message in the `onerror.cfm` file to be displayed to the users whenever 
your site throws an error. When this page is shown a HTTP status code of 500 (Internal Server Error) 
will also be sent.

If you need to access the error information here (for logging purposes, for example) it is available at 
`arguments.exception`.

### On Missing Template

The `onmissingtemplate.cfm` file works in a similar way as the error file above, but it gets called when 
a `controller` or `action` in your application could not be found. When this page is shown a HTTP status 
code of 404 (Not Found) will also be sent.

Note: If you want to make sure that all browsers show your custom 404 page you need to make it larger 
than 512 bytes in size. Google Chrome, for example, will display a friendly help page of its own when 
the 404 page is less than 512 bytes.

## Adding Functions

Sometimes it's useful to add functions right in the `Application.cfc` file to make them available to all 
templates. To achieve the same thing in Wheels you can place your functions in `events/functions.cfm`.

## Application Settings

Again, because there is no `Application.cfc` file for you to work with in Wheels, you have to find a 
suitable place to set application settings such as `this.SessionManagement`, `this.SessionTimeout`, 
`this.ScriptProtect`, `this.SetClientCookies`, and so on. These are usually set in the constructor area 
of an `Application.cfc` file. We recommend that you set them in the `config/app.cfm` file instead.
