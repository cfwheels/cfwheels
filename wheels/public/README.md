### /wheels/route-tester
A POST endpoint for internal use in the above route tester

### /wheels/docs
All internal documentation - a merged collection of the core documenation and any other documentation that the developer sees fit to add to their app (assuming it matches the javaDoc style output of the internal functions)

### /wheels/packages
Displays all Core (if using master branch), App & Plugin Test packages. Includes a testrunner which can return multiple formats - html, json, junit

### /wheels/tests
The actual test runner

### /wheels/migrator
The database migration system

### /wheels/cli
Various endpoints for exclusive use by the CLI

### /wheels/plugins
All the Wheels plugins loaded and as much information as we have about them
