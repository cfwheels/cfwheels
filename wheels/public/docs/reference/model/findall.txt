// Similar to the above but using the association in the opposite direction (which needs to be setup as a `hasMany` association to `article` on the `author` model)  bobsArticles = model("author").findAll( include="articles", where="firstName='Bob'" );

// Using pagination (getting records 26-50 in this case) and a more complex way to include associations (a song `belongsTo` an album, which in turn `belongsTo` an artist)  songs = model("song").findAll( include="album(artist)", page=2, perPage=25 );

// Using a dynamic finder to get all books released a certain year. Same as calling model("book").findOne(where="releaseYear=#params.year#")

// If you have a `hasMany` association setup from `post` to `comment`, you can do a scoped call. (The `comments` method below will call `model("comment").findAll(where="postId=#post.id#")` internally)

// If you have an `Order` model with properties for `productId`, `amount` and a calculated property named `totalAmount` (set up as `property(name="totalAmount", sql="SUM(amount)")`), then you can do the following to get the ids for all products with over $1,000 in sales (the SQL will be created using `HAVING` instead of `WHERE` in this case since you're getting an aggregate value for a calculated property)
ids = model("order").findAll(group="productId", where="totalAmount > 1000");
