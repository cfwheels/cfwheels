                        ColdFusion on Wheels (CFWheels)

What is it?
-----------
Coldfusion on Wheels (henceforth referred to simply as CFWheels)
is a framework for ColdFusion interpreters (see interpreters below).
It is heavily based on Ruby on Rails, but it's not a direct port.
Some modifications have been made to better fit the CFML language.
Some of the benefits to using CFWheels are:
 * Convention Over Configuration to quickly get started
 * Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
 * Object Relational Mapping (ORM) for writing less SQL
 * Clean code that's quick to read and easy to understand
 * Encourages best practices, but does not require them.
 * Plug-ins to enhance the framework functionality

Installation (see below for upgrading)
--------------------------------------
CFWheels installation is quick and easy.  Copy the directories
included in the ZIP file to your application server.  These
can be placed within the webroot itself, or a folder off the
webroot directory.

Once copied, open your browser and navigate to the directory
on your application server where you installed CFWheels. You
should be presented with a welcome message telling you that
CFWheels is running successfully.

Upgrading
---------
To upgrade an existing CFWheels application, just copy the 
wheels folder from the new ZIP file and replace the current 
wheels folder in your application.  Lastly, make sure to reload
your application for all of the new awesomeness to start powering
your app!
