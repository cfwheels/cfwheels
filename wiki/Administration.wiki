All sample applications comes full of comments so it's a good way to learn Wheels if
you're one of those people who prefer playing around with code rather than reading more abstract tutorials.

This sample application covers how to setup validation rules on a model, make a form for it, save to the database and so on.

==Instructions==

Create a new database with a table named `users` containing the following columns:

|| *Name* || *Type* || *Nullable* || *Primary Key* ||
|| id || int, identity || No || Yes ||
|| firstname || varchar(100) || No || No ||
|| lastname || varchar(100) || No || No ||
|| email || varchar(100) || No || No ||
|| password || varchar(20) || No || No ||

Add a data source in the !ColdFusion or Railo Administrator named `cfwheelsUserAdministration` pointing to your new database.

Once that's all done just download, unzip and run the app (it comes
with !ColdFusion on Wheels 0.9 included).
