#summary Let Wheels handle time stamping of records.
#labels chapter,0.9.1

When working with database tables, it is very common to have a column that holds the time that the record was added or last modified. If you have an e-commerce website with an orders table, you want to store the date and time the order was made; if you run a blog, you want to know when someone left a comment; and so on.

As with anything that is a common task performed by many developers, it makes a good candidate for abstracting to the framework level. So that's what we did.

==Columns Used for Timestamps==

If you have either of the following columns in your database table, Wheels will see them and treat them a little differently than others.

===`createdAt`===

Wheels will use a `createdAt` column automatically to store the current date and time when an `INSERT` operation is made (which could happen through a `save()` or `create()` operation, for example).

===`updatedAt`===

If Wheels sees an `updatedAt` column, it will use it to store the current date and time automatically when an `UPDATE` operation is made (which could happen through a [save save()] or [update update()] operation, for example).

==Data Type of Columns==

If you add any of these columns to your table, make sure they can accept date/time values (like `datetime` or `timestamp`, for example) and that they can be set to `null`.
