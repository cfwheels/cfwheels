#summary Instructions for installing Wheels on your system.
#labels chapter,0.8

Installing Wheels is so simple that there is barely a need for a chapter devoted to it. But we figured we'd better make one anyway in case anyone is specifically looking for a chapter about installation.

So, here are the simple steps you need to follow to get rolling on Wheels...

==1. Download Wheels==

You have two choices when downloading Wheels. You can either use the latest official release of Wheels, or you can take a walk on the wild side and go with the latest committed source code in our Subversion (SVN) repository.

The latest official release can be found in the [http://www.cfwheels.com/download downloads section] of this website, and the SVN trunk is available at our [http://code.google.com/p/cfwheels Google Code site].

In most cases, we recommend going with the official release because it's well documented and has been through a lot of bug testing. Only if you're in desperate need of a feature that has not been released yet would we advise you to go with the version stored in the SVN trunk.

Let's assume you have downloaded the latest official release. (Really, you should go with this option.) You now have a `.zip` file saved somewhere on your computer. On to the next step...

==2. Setup the Website==

Getting an empty website running with Wheels installed is an easy process if you already know your way around IIS or Apache. Basically, you need to create a new website in your web server of choice and unzip the contents of the file into the root of it.

In case your not sure, here are the instructions for setting up an empty Wheels site that can be accessed when typing `localhost` in your browser. The instructions refer to a system running Windows Server 2003 and IIS, but you should be able to follow along and apply the instructions with minor modifications to your system. (See the [Requirements requirements chapter] for a list of tested systems).

 * Create a new folder under your web root (usually `C:\Inetpub\wwwroot`) named `mysite` and unzip the Wheels `.zip` file into the root of it.
 * Create a new website using IIS called `My Site` with `localhost` as the host header name and `C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\mysite` as the path to your home directory.

If you want to run a Wheels powered application from a sub folder in an existing website, this is entirely possible, but you'll have to live with the fact that you can never turn on URL rewriting and get those pretty URLs (read more about this in the [URLRewriting URL Rewriting chapter]).

==3. Setup the Database==

Setting up the database is actually a completely optional step. You can run a Wheels site without ever involving a database. But because it's highly unlikely you would do that, we're including the instructions in this chapter.

Create a new database in SQL Server or MySQL and add a new data source for it named `wheels` in the ColdFusion/Railo Administrator, just as you'd normally do. This is really all that you need to do before Wheels can connect to your database and start working its magic.

If you wish to name your data source differently or have Wheels use the username/password in your code instead of through the ColdFusion/Railo Administrator, this is all possible via different configuration settings. You can read more about that in the [Configuration configuration chapter].

==4. Test It==

When you've configured the web server and database, you can test your installation by typing `http://localhost` (or whatever you set as the host header name) in your web browser. You should get a page saying "Congratulations!"

That's it. You're done. This is where the fun begins!
