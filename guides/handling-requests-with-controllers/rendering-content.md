# Rendering Content

A big part of a controller's task is to respond to the user. In Wheels you can\
respond to the user in three different ways:

* Displaying content
* Redirecting to another URL
* Sending a file

You can only respond once per request. If you do not explicitly call any of the\
response functions ( [renderView()](https://api.cfwheels.org/v2.2#controller.renderview), [sendFile()](https://api.cfwheels.org/v2.2#controller.sendfile) etc) then Wheels will\
assume that you want to show the view for the current controller and action and\
do it for you.

This chapter covers the first method listed above—displaying content. The\
chapters about [Redirecting Users](https://guides.cfwheels.org/cfwheels-guides/handling-requests-with-controllers/redirecting-users) and [Sending Files](https://guides.cfwheels.org/cfwheels-guides/handling-requests-with-controllers/sending-files) cover the other two\
response methods.

### Rendering a Page

This is the most common way of responding to the user. It's done with the\
[renderView()](https://api.cfwheels.org/v2.2#controller.renderview) function, but most often you probably won't call it\
yourself and instead let Wheels do it for you.

Sometimes you will want to call it though and specify to show a view page for a\
controller/action other than the current one. One common technique for handling\
a form submission, for example, is to show the view page for the\
controller/action that contains the form (as opposed to the one that just\
handles the form submission and redirects the user afterwards). When doing this,\
it's very important to keep in mind that [renderView()](https://api.cfwheels.org/v2.2#controller.renderview) will\
**not run the code** for the controller's action—all it does is process the view\
page for it.

You can also call [renderView()](https://api.cfwheels.org/v2.2#controller.renderview) explicitly if you wish to cache the response\
or use a different layout than the default one.

If the `controller` and `action` arguments do not give you enough flexibility,\
you can use the `template` argument that is available for [renderView()](https://api.cfwheels.org/v2.2#controller.renderview).

Refer to the [Pages](https://guides.cfwheels.org/cfwheels-guides/displaying-views-to-users/pages) chapter for more details about rendering content. More\
specifically, that chapter describes where to place those files and what goes in\
them.

### Rendering a Partial

This is done with the [renderPartial()](https://api.cfwheels.org/controller.renderpartial.html) function. It's most often used with\
AJAX requests that are meant to update only parts of a page.

### Rendering Nothing at All

Sometimes you don't need to return anything at all to the browser. Perhaps\
you've made an AJAX request that does not require a response or executed a\
scheduled task that no end user sees the results of. In these cases you can use\
the [renderNothing()](https://api.cfwheels.org/controller.rendernothing.html) function to tell Wheels to just render an empty page to\
the browser.

### Rendering Text

This is done with the [renderText()](https://api.cfwheels.org/controller.rendertext.html) function. It just returns the text you\
specify. In reality it is rarely used but could be useful as a response to AJAX\
requests sometimes.

### Rendering to a Variable

Normally when you call any of the rendering functions, the result is stored\
inside an internal Wheels variable. This value is then outputted to the browser\
at the end of the request.

Sometimes you may want to do some additional processing on the rendering result\
before outputting it though. This is where the `returnAs` argument comes in\
handy. It's available on both [renderView()](https://api.cfwheels.org/v2.2/controller.renderView.html) and [renderPartial()](https://api.cfwheels.org/controller.renderpartial.html).\
Setting `returnAs` to `string` will return the result to you instead of placing\
it in the internal Wheels variable.

### Caching the Response

Two of the functions listed above are capable of caching the content for you;\
[renderView()](https://api.cfwheels.org/v2.2/controller.renderView.html) and [renderPartial()](https://api.cfwheels.org/controller.renderpartial.html). Just pass in `cache=true` (to use\
the default cache time set in `config/settings.cfm`) or `cache=x` where `x` is\
the number of minutes you want to cache the content for. Keep in mind that this\
caching respects the global setting set for it in your configuration files so\
normally no pages will be cached when in Design or Development mode.

We cover caching in greater detail in the [Caching](https://guides.cfwheels.org/cfwheels-guides/handling-requests-with-controllers/caching) chapter.

### Using a Layout

The [renderView()](https://api.cfwheels.org/v2.2/controller.renderView.html) function accepts an argument named `layout`. Using this\
you can wrap your content with common header/footer style code. This is such an\
important concept though so we'll cover all the details of it in the chapter\
called [Using Layouts](https://guides.cfwheels.org/cfwheels-guides/displaying-views-to-users/layouts).
