# CLI Commands

The command line tools extends the functionality of CommandBox with some commands specifically designed for CFWheels development. These tools allow you to adopt a more modern workflow and allow you to create and manipulate many CFWheels objects from the command line. By making these tools available in the command line, not only will you be able to speed up your development but you can also utilize these commands in Continous Integration (CI) and Continous Deployment (CD) work flows.
