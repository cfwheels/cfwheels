# wheels generate - commands

These are the commands in the `wheels generate` namespace. These commands are called by some of
the top level commands but you can use them directly to speed up your development proces.

## `wheels generate`

The `wheels generate` command is what CommandBox calls a namespace and contains many sub commands beneeth it. It's main purpose is to isolate those sub commands so there is no name collisions. It also has an alias of `wheels g` which allows you to shorten the commands you have to type. However, we have opted to show all the commands with their full names in the list below.

## `wheels generate app-wizard`

Creates a new CFWheels application using our wizard to gather all the necessary information. This is the recommended route to start a new application.

This command will ask for:

* An Application Name (a new directoery will be created with this name)
* Template to use
* A reload Password
* A datasource name
* What local cfengine you want to run
* If using Lucee, do you want to setup a local h2 dev database
* Do you want to initialize the app as a ForgBox module

```
wheels new
wheels g app-wizard
wheels generate app-wizard
```

All these three commands areequivelent and will call the same wizard. The wizard in turn gathers all the required data and passes it all off to the `wheels generate app` command to do all the heavy lifting.

Let's take a look at the wizard pages after issuing the `wheels new` command:

![wheels new - step 1](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-06-18 at 12.30.34 PM.png>)

You can accept the name offered or change it to whatever name you like. We try to clean up the name and take out special characters and spaces if we need to.

![wheels new - step 2](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-06-18 at 12.31.01 PM.png>)

You can select a template to use. If you are reading this before CFWheels 2.4 is released you may want to select the Bleeding Edge Base Template.

![wheels new - step 3](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-06-18 at 12.32.14 PM.png>)

You can set what you want to use as your reload password or accept the default. Please make sure to change this before you go into produciton. Ideally this should be kept out of your source repository by using somethign like the (CFWheels DotEnvSettings Plugin)\[[https://www.forgebox.io/view/cfwheels-dotenvsettings](https://www.forgebox.io/view/cfwheels-dotenvsettings)].

![wheels new - step 4](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-06-18 at 12.32.43 PM.png>)

The datasource is somethign you'll have to take care of unless you opt to use the H2 Embedded database in a Lucee server. Here you can define the datasource name if you would like to use something different than the application name.

![wheels new - step 5](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-06-18 at 12.33.18 PM.png>)

In this step you can choose what CF Engine and version to launch. Lucee has an embedded SQL compliant database server called H2. So if you use one of the Lucee options you can specify to use the H2 database as well. Notice the last item allows you to specify the module slug or URI to a CF Engine not on the list.

![wheels new - step 6](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-06-18 at 12.34.17 PM.png>)

On this step you are asked if you'd like to use the H2 Database, in which case we can set everything up for you, or if you would prefer to use another database engine and will take care of setting up the database yourself.

![wheels new - step 7](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-06-18 at 12.34.44 PM.png>)

On this last step, you are asked if you want us to include a box.json file so you can eventually submit this to ForgeBox.io for sharing witht he world.

![wheels new - step 8](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-06-18 at 12.35.09 PM.png>)

This is the confirmation screen that shows all the choices you've made and gives you one last chance to bail out. If you choose to continue, the choices you've made will be sent over to the `wheels g app` command to do the actual app creation.

![wheels new - final screen](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-06-18 at 12.35.40 PM.png>)

If you opted to continue you'll see a bunch of things scroll across your screen as the various items are downloaded and configured. Eventually you will see this status screen letting you know that everything was installed properly.&#x20;

## `wheels generate app`

Create a blank CFWheels app from one of our app templates or a template using a valid Endpoint ID which can come from ForgeBox, HTTP/S, git, github, etc.

By default an app named MyCFWheelsApp will be created in a sub directoryt call MyCFWheelsApp.

The most basic call...
```
wheels generate app
```

This can be shortened to...
```
wheels g app
```

Here are the basic templates that are available for you that come from ForgeBox
- CFWheels Base Template - Stable (default)
- CFWheels Base Template - Bleeding Edge
- CFWheels Template - HelloWorld
- CFWheels Template - HelloDynamic
- CFWheels Template - HelloPages
- CFWheels Example App
- CFWheels - TodoMVC - HTMX - Demp App

```
wheels create app template=base
```
The template parameter can also be any valid Endpoint ID, which includes a Git repo or HTTP URL pointing to a package. So you can use this to publish your own templates to use to start new projects.

```
wheels create app template=http://site.com/myCustomAppTemplate.zip
```
