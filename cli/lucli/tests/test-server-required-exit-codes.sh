# Regression tests for commands that require a running Wheels dev server.
#
# GH #2229 — commands that detected "no running server" previously printed a
# red diagnostic and `return ""`, producing exit 0. MCP clients and shell
# automation couldn't distinguish "succeeded with no output" from "server
# down, nothing ran". All such paths now throw `Wheels.ServerNotRunning` via
# the shared `$requireRunningServer()` helper so LuCLI's ExecutionException-
# Handler surfaces a non-zero exit.
#
# Commands exercised (issue-listed + same-bug-pattern paths found in audit):
#   wheels routes          — issue-listed
#   wheels reload          — issue-listed
#   wheels test            — issue-listed (via private runTests)
#   wheels migrate info    — surfaced by audit (same pattern)
#   wheels seed            — surfaced by audit (same pattern)
#   wheels db status       — surfaced by audit (same pattern)
#   wheels db version      — surfaced by audit (same pattern)
#
# `wheels console` is excluded here — its success path reads from stdin.
# Connection/eval failures now throw `Wheels.ConsoleFailed` (same print-then-
# throw contract as reload). Covered by ConsoleCommandSpec source + helper
# tests, not this no-server smoke.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - wheels binary on PATH
#   - No Wheels dev server running on 8080/60000/3000/8500
#
# Usage:
#   bash cli/lucli/tests/test-server-required-exit-codes.sh

# NOTE: no `set -e` — we want to observe non-zero exits.
